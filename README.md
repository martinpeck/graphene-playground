# Graphene Playgroup

This repo contains some code I wrote while playing (fighting) with Graphene.

There's not much here. Deal with it.

If you want to run the code...

* use Python 3.x (
* create a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv` will do it)
* install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run stuff using Python (e.g. `python hello.py`)
